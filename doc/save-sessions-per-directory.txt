                                                *:StartKeepingSession*
:StartKeepingSession      Starts saving the session in a .vim directory in the current working
                            directory. From now on, if you open vim from that directory (without
                            specifying any args), it will resume your session.

                                                *:STARTKEEPINGSESSION*
:STARTKEEPINGSESSION        Equivalent to |:StartKeepingSession|.
                            This capitalized command is defined so that an abbreviated version 
                            can more easily be typed, like ":STA" (see |user-cmd-ambiguous|).

                                                *:StopKeepingSession*
:StopKeepingSession       Removes the session file, and removes auto-saving of sessions.

                                                *:STOPKEEPINGSESSION*
:STOPKEEPINGSESSION        Equivalent to |:StopKeepingSession|.
                            This capitalized command is defined so that an abbreviated version 
                            can more easily be typed, like ":STO" (see |user-cmd-ambiguous|).
