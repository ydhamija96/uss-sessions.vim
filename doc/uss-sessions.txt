                                                *:StartKeepingSession*
:StartKeepingSession      Starts saving the session in a .vim directory in the current working
                            directory. From now on, if you open vim from that directory (without
                            specifying any args), it will resume your session.

                                                *:StopKeepingSession*
:StopKeepingSession       Removes the session file, and removes auto-saving of sessions.
